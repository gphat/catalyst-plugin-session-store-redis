Revision history for Catalyst-Plugin-Session-Store-Redis

0.04    April 20, 2016
    - Allow arbitrary configuration keys to be passed to Redis constructor

0.03    December 12th, 2009
    - Fix POD description
    - Fix logging typo (said 'Getting key' when it meant 'Setting key')
    - Use Redis' EXPIRE command to build in session expiration so we can
      ignore it. As such, delete_expired_sessions is now a null-op.
    - Unify connection code that was previously duplicated in setup_session
    - Test against Redis 1.02 and 1.1.91-beta
